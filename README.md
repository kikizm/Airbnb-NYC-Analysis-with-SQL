- Rank them to find the most concentrated areas.

**Query:**


```sql
SELECT 
    neighbourhood_group,
    neighbourhood,
    COUNT(id) AS total_listings
FROM `New.AB_NYC_2019`

### **2. Price Comparison Across Boroughs**

**Steps:**

- Calculate average, minimum, and maximum prices by borough (neighbourhood_group).
- Exclude extreme outliers for a cleaner view.

**Query:**


```sql
SELECT 
  neighbourhood_group,
  ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price,
  ROUND(MIN(price), 2) AS min_price,
  ROUND(MAX(price), 2) AS max_price
FROM `New.AB_NYC_2019`
WHERE price > 0 AND price < 1000
GROUP BY neighbourhood_group
ORDER BY avg_price DESC

```

```sql
SELECT 
  host_id,
  host_name,
  SUM(CAST(price AS float64) * CAST(minimum_nights AS float64)) AS est_revenue
FROM (
  SELECT *
  FROM `New.AB_NYC_2019`
  WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 1000
) AS f
GROUP BY host_id, host_name
ORDER BY est_revenue DESC

**Steps:**

- Use review as a proxy for listing activity.
- Count total listings per year.
- Exclude null dates.

SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SAFE_CAST(last_review AS DATE)) AS year,
    COUNT(id) AS total_listings
FROM `New.AB_NYC_2019`
WHERE last_review IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year

```

  x.avg_price,
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY x.avg_price DESC) AS price_rank

  y.room_type,
  y.avg_price,
  y.total_listings,
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY y.avg_price) AS price_quartile
FROM(
  SELECT 
    room_type,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(price AS float64)), 2) AS avg_price,

        ELSE 'Single listing'
    END AS host_tier,
    COUNT(DISTINCT host_id) AS hosts,
